    <h1> Loops </h1>
    <p> Technical definition: a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
    Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked 
    such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>

    <h2> Conditionals </h2>
    <p> Technical definition:conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform 
    different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.</p>
