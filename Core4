    <h1> Loops </h1>
    <p> Technical definition: a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
    Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked 
    such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>
    <p> Real life example:A train which makes the same stops each rotation. It does not stop until told to. t</p>

    <h2> Conditionals </h2>
    <p> Technical definition:conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform 
    different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.</p>
    <p> Real life example: If you go on the 405, then you will hit traffic. Else, if you take the 10, then there won't be as much traffic. </p>

    <h3> Variable </h3>
    <p> Technical definition: a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which 
    contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. ... Compilers have to replace variables' symbolic 
    names with the actual locations of the data.</p>
