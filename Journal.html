  <p> Today, I learned how to make shapes on Python. We learned about Python and the similiarties and differences between Python and Scratch. Scratch is made to be easy for beginners as it gives you sprites and all 
    of the commands are in blocks, instead of making the user type everything out. Scratch was definately very helpful to start out with because I got to build off of what I learned and apply it to Python. In Python, 
    the user does have to type out the commands and I found this a little bit more difficult to get things in order by indentation. I am still trying to figure out in my code on how to make something occur after 
    every time in the "while true" aka "forever loop. However, they do have similar functions and it made my experience with Python very helpful. I am still trying to debug my code so that the shape making continues
    forever in different locations.</p>

  <p> Lists work similary to strings and use [] to store the data with the first element starting at 0 then goes up. There are different 
    python functions that go with lists. For example, there are append put bracket and adds to the list as one new variable. There is extend 
and you put it in brackets and the variables go into the list. Tuples are like a list but you can't change it so you can't append or extend.
Searching lists/ list.index('blah')tell you where something is in the list.
To find where something is in a list, use print(five_syllable.index('There was a kitty')) --> it'll print the number. 

    
    #extend put bracket and put variables into the list </p>

  <p> Today we learned about robots and what defines a robot. We decided that a robot would: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> have sensors </li>
    <li> source of energy </li> </ul>
  <p>After a long weekend, we started making a circuit using Arduino. We lit up a LED using resistors, a breadboard, a Shield, jumper cables, and LEDs. 
    We also lit it up through series and parallel circuit and using a button to stop or start the flow of currents. We also used a piezo which would 
    vibrate and create a buzzing noise. Here's an example of the parallel which used two resistors and two LEDs. </p>

   <p> Today, we learned how to code a blinking LED light by using the breadboard on the Shield. We connected it to the computer in order to power the 
    Arduino. Afterwards, we programmed five different LEDs to make a little lightshow. Since we were finished with the project, we decided to
    assemble part of the kit. After looking up a servos code, we programmed the servos so the wheels would "pulse" little by little. </p>
