    <h1> Loops </h1>
    <p>What's a Loop?: A loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
    Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked 
    such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>
    <p> Real life example:A train which makes the same stops each rotation. It does not stop until told to. </p>
    <p> Scratch: The orange "forever" block represents the forever loop until the user tells the computer. </p>

    <h1> Conditionals </h1>
    <p> What's a conditional?: A conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform 
    different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.</p>
    <p> Real life example: If you go on the 405 freeway, then there will be traffic. If you go on the 10 freeway, there won't be as 
    much traffic. </p>
    <p> Scratch:The "if" block is the conditional and all of the blocks inside represent the "then" of a conditional. </p>

    <h1> Variable </h1>
    <p> What's a variable?: A variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which 
    contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.Compilers have to replace variables' symbolic 
    names with the actual locations of the data.</p>
    <p> Real life example: If you are measuring your heart rate while you are running, the heart rate would be a variable as 
    it changes when you run. </p>
    <p> Scratch: The orange "costume" block is a variable in Scratch. The user can call the variable to make it work a 
    certain way. In this example, there are 6 different costumes and the code tells the computer to pick a random costume and to change 
    it to that costume. </p>

    <p> Python: "first_input= input" is an example of a variable. We programmed it so whenever we use "first_input", it would gt the input from 
    the specific input. </p>

    <h1> Functions </h1>
    <p> What's a function?: A function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a 
    function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.</p>
    <p> Real life example: A scavenger hunt is an example of a function. It tells you where to go step by step and there is an outcome at
    the end. </p>
    <p> Scratch: The purple block allows the user to define a function by putting certain blocks underneath it. 
    Therefore, if an user want to use the function, there is another purple block which calls the specific function.</p>

    <p> Python: "image_list" is an example of a function. In the code, the image_list goes through a list of different instructions.</p>
